# IHNIL - I Hate Nested If Loops

## Description

Prounced: "eye-nil"  
For use on Python code modules. :snake:  
I hate nested "if" loops. They're ugly, they're slow, they've got to go.  
While there are *some* instances where they are necessary, let's see if we  
can get rid of all of the useless ones.  

## Usage

After installation, run via with the arguments below in the terminal:  

```
python3 reader.py [ -r/--read | -w/--read ] [ -h/--help ] filename  
```  

The default optional argument is ` -r / --read `.  
Currently only available for Python 3.
